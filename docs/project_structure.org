* Core Directories

** src/
The main source code directory containing all Aphrodite engine components:

*** Engine Components
- =api/= - Backend API implementations (Vulkan)
- =app/= - Application framework
- =common/= - Common utilities and definitions
- =engine/= - Core engine functionality
- =event/= - Event system
- =filesystem/= - File system utilities
- =global/= - Global state and configuration
- =input/= - Input handling
- =math/= - Mathematical utilities
- =module/= - Modular components
- =renderGraph/= - Render graph system
- =resource/= - Resource management
- =scene/= - Scene graph and management
- =threads/= - Threading and concurrency
- =ui/= - User interface components
- =wsi/= - Window System Integration

** examples/
Contains example applications demonstrating Aphrodite engine features:

- =hello_aphrodite/= - Basic example showing core rendering features
- =render_graph_visualizer/= - Utility for visualizing render graph structures

** docs/
Documentation for various aspects of the engine:

- =dependency_grapher.org= - Documentation for the CMake dependency graph tool
- =project_structure.org= - This file describing the overall project structure
- =cmake_formatter.org= - Documentation for the CMake formatting tool
- =include_sorter.org= - Documentation for the include sorting tool
- =container_build.org= - Documentation for containerized build environment

*** Dependency Graph
The project includes tooling to visualize component dependencies:

#+CAPTION: Aphrodite Engine Component Dependencies
#+NAME: fig:project-dependencies
[[file:cmake_dependency_graph.svg]]

The dependency graph shows all engine components and their relationships. Green arrows represent PUBLIC dependencies, while blue arrows indicate PRIVATE dependencies.

** assets/
Engine assets such as textures, models, and shaders.

** scripts/
Utility scripts for development and maintenance:

- =dependency_grapher.py= - Generates CMake dependency graph
- =cmake_formatter.py= - Formats CMake files for consistency
- =include_sorter.py= - Sorts include statements in source files
- =container_builder.py= - Builds the project in a containerized environment

** patches/
External library code patches.

** container/
Container configuration for building the project in isolated environments:

- =Dockerfile= - Docker/Podman container definition
